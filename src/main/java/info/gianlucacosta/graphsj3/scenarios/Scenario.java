/**
 * The layer enabling you to interact with the internals of GraphsJ.
 * <p>
 * Scenario provides, on purpose, several features, orchestrating how GraphsJ
 * should deal with your algorithm; in particular:
 * <ul> <li>Creating the GraphContext on which the algorithm will operate</li>
 * <li>Creating the graph canvas employed by the user to edit the graph</li>
 * <li>Writing runtime metainfo on the dedicated copy of the graph context that
 * is provided by GraphsJ on algorithm execution - the purpose of that copy is
 * to allow both the developer and the user to change the graph context at will
 * at runtime, without affecting the original graph context</li>
 * <li>Creating an instance of the algorithm whenever the user requests to run it</li>
 * <li>Returning its settings and provide a way to let the user change them</li>
 * <li>Creating wrappers for both vertexes and links, used by GraphsJ's input
 * dialogs</li>
 * <li>Optionally providing HTML documentation to the user</li>
 * </ul>
